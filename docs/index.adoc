Expert Level

The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects.

The terminology used in the iSAQB curricula can be found as a (freely available) ebook, published on https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read[Leanpub].

== Development versions

The regulations and criteria of the Expert Level are currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE).
Maintainers and volunteer reviewers collaborate on GitHub to improve those documents.
