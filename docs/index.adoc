Expert Level

The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects.

The terminology used in the iSAQB curricula can be found as a (freely available) ebook, published on https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read[Leanpub].

The regulations and criteria of the Expert Level are currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE).
Maintainers and volunteer reviewers collaborate on https://github.com/isaqb-org/examination-expert[GitHub] to improve those documents.
